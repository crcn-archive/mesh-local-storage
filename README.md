This module is a local storage database adapter for [crudlet](https://github.com/crcn/crudlet.js) - a library that makes it easy to persist data through multiple transports.

#### Features

- offline-mode - enable users to browse your application without an API (assuming there's local data)
- faster initial load times - great for mobile devices
- can be used with other database transports such as [crudlet-http](https://github.com/crcn/crudlet-http)
- cascades operations to other transports
